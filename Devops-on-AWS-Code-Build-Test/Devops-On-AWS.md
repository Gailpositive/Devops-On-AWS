# CREATING A REACT GAME WEB APP ON AWS DEVOPS
## Introduction to AWS DevOps  practices, and tools to deliver applications and services faster and at a higher quality. 
### Exercise: Setting Up Development Environment
In a production environment, I'd create a custom policy in AWS IAM for precise control. However, for this exercise, I skip that. I'm setting up a development space with AWS Cloud9, downloading code, and using AWS SAM CLI to build a serverless app. It includes backend elements like API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and a smart process. The frontend, a React web app, sits in an S3 bucket. Finally, I store my progress in AWS CodeCommit once the app is running.

### AWS APPLICATION used:  
* AWS Cloud9 development environment for a sample application
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
* Amazon API Gateway REST API
* Amazon DynamoDB table
* AWS Step Functions state machine
* AWS Lambda functions
* The final exercise includes instructions to delete all the resources created in the exercises.

### Learning Objectives
* Setting up  my development environment on AWS Cloud9
* Explore how I can use AWS CodeBuild to build and test code with continuous scaling
* Evaluate Git branching strategies


### Task 1: Create cloud9 environment and downloading the application

* Give the app a name, brief description and create a new ec2 instance for the app to run on

* Trivial-app created
<img width="914" alt="5" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Aws-Networking-Implementation-Projects/assets/111061512/32029298-184d-4bed-bf1a-677cd890a62e">

* Cloud9 environment IDE terminal opened
<img width="958" alt="6" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Aws-Networking-Implementation-Projects/assets/111061512/78008e02-0abd-4993-bdfa-3b47a1170e43">

* Download the application and unzip the file
<img width="960" alt="4" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Aws-Networking-Implementation-Projects/assets/111061512/50b7a130-7d7e-424f-89a3-50c900425487">

### Task 2: In deploying AWS serverless application model (SAM) & AWS command line interface (CLI) to create the back-end infrastracture, 
* I cd into the app folder and  use SAM to build the template.yaml file.
* Successfully created/updated stack - trivia-app in us-west-2
* From the Outputs table in the terminal output, I copy and saved the Websocket Value

 ### Task 3: Testing the frontend on cloud9
*  SAM deployed
*  i cd into the path "trivia-app/front-end-react/src/config.js"
*  Cat the "config.js" file to view the websocketend point to update
*  To update the websocketend point, I Vi  "confif.js"
*  Update it with the websocket value copied and saved ealier

* To simplify Node.js version manager, I install nvm and set it to the v16 (codename: Gallium)

* I cd into the front-end-react directory and install the NPM dependencies
* NPM installation complied successful
* In the AWS Cloud9 menu bar, I click Preview and click Preview Running Application

### Task 4: Deploying the frontend to an S3 bucket
* Execute the AWS cli command to create the S3 bucket
* Gave it a name with the strings "trivia-app-bucket"
* Run the command to build my web application
* Application build successfully
<img width="882" alt="10" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Devops-On-AWS/assets/111061512/b5875f1f-60dc-44c3-b5a1-8a6df3dab0ed">

* Deploy the build artifacts to the S3 buckets
* There was an error issue,the bucket does not allow or support ACLs-Access Control List
<img width="960" alt="12" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Devops-On-AWS/assets/111061512/7b7e2516-e48d-421f-aa83-6e3470813567">

*To resolves this problem, I either update the sync command to exclude the "acl public-read" part which will use the defualt ACL settings for the bucket or update S3 policies
<img width="680" alt="15 removed ACLs" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Devops-On-AWS/assets/111061512/8794501c-e093-410e-ba39-12e76bfb9f64">

* Since my intent is to make the objects in the S3 bucket publicly readable, than I updated the S3 bucket policy to allow public read access
* To do this, in the S3 bucket, I navigate to the permisssion tab to update permissions and the bucket policy 
<img width="902" alt="13" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Devops-On-AWS/assets/111061512/c89727af-3d7e-49f5-af6d-5b62fc9de543">

* I turned off "block public access"

* Editing the bucket policy
<img width="693" alt="16" src="https://github.com/Gailpositive/Devops-On-AWS/assets/111061512/c8303e77-efbc-4512-ac2b-8e4df6098e2f">

* Json policy allowing public read to all object
* The Resource field in the policy specifies the bucket ARN (Amazon Resource Name), determiningthe precise scope of permissions and allowing detailed control

* Object Ownership not transferable to another AWS account or entity. Ownership model is fundamental to S3's access control and security mechanisms.

 * Enable ACLs (Access Control List) to grant only read access to this object and bucket

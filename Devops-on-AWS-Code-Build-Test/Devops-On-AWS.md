### Learning Objectives
* Describe how the DevOps model benefits development and operations teams
* Explain DevOps cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
* Use AWS Cloud9 to set up my development environment
* Explore how I can use AWS CodeBuild to build and test code with continuous scaling
* Evaluate Git branching strategies

### Exercise: Setting Up Development Environment
In a production environment, I'd create a custom policy in AWS IAM for precise control. However, for this exercise, I skip that. I'm setting up a development space with AWS Cloud9, downloading code, and using AWS SAM CLI to build a serverless app. It includes backend elements like API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and a smart process. The frontend, a React web app, sits in an S3 bucket. Finally, I store my progress in AWS CodeCommit once the app is running.
